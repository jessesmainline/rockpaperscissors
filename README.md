Rock Paper Scissors
or RPS, rps.

A noob's first javascript program for The Odin Project, a 90% milestone of the Foundation's course, meaning I'm almost half-done. Pat on the back.

I'm tasked here with writing a rock, paper, scissor program that simulates the game normally played between two people using their hands. Not quite the same experience with a computer mouse.

For posterity, in case we experience an apocolyptic future where we stop having hands and human interaction, I'll explain what this game accomplishes. Playing settles wagers and disagreements with a zero-sum game. Only one player wins. In real life, to play the game, each player says aloud "Rock, paper, scissors!" and upon saying the last word, reveals their choice of tool--a handsign that uses their hand to make the shape of one of the options: rock, paper, or scissors. Paper beats Rock, Scissors beats Paper, and Rock beats Scissors. If two players play the same hand, it's a tie and the game is played again until one person beats the other. Each win is a point, and the first person to win two out of three untied-matches wins, for example. 

In this version, you simply click a button and wait to see if you win against the computer. Not quite the same effect, but could be fun?

I went with a retro style to symbolize the early days of gaming, when the best game in town was pong. 

Enjoy!
